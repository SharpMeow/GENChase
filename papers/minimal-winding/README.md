## Abstract

In a self-similar collapse of point vortices every vortex moves on a logarithmic spiral, and the angle
$P$ through which the configuration turns while the square of its size decreases by the factor $e$
measures how tightly the spiral winds; for the Euler equation $P = |\omega_0| t_c$, the initial angular
velocity times the collapse time. For three Euler vortices with circulations $(1, \mu, -\mu/(1 + \mu))$,
$0 < \mu \le 1$, the collapsing configurations form two arcs, one for each orientation of the triangle,
and $P$ has exactly one critical point, a minimum, on each. The squared minima are roots of an explicit
cubic, and the smaller one increases from $\sqrt{3}/2$, approached as $\mu \to 0$, to $\sqrt{2}$ at $\mu
= 1$. Hence $P > \sqrt{3}/2$ for every self-similar collapse of three point vortices, and the constant
is sharp: every vortex travels more than twice its initial distance from the collision point. In the
$\alpha$-models, where a vortex induces the velocity $\Gamma r^{-\alpha-1}/(2\pi)$, every self-similar
collapse of three vortices has $P > \sqrt{3 + \alpha}/(2 + \alpha)$ for $\alpha > -2$, again sharply.
For two concentric regular $n$-gons, with or without a vortex at the center, $P$ has a closed form, and
its minimum is explicit and exceeds $\sqrt{3}/2$. A strong vortex with weak, tight opposite-signed pairs
has $P > \sqrt{3}/2$ once the pairs are weak enough. For more vortices the bound fails. Computer-assisted
proofs show that four, five and six Euler vortices collapse self-similarly with $P < \sqrt{3}/2$, that
$P$ has strict local minima $0.7978967838\ldots$, $0.7448144569\ldots$ and $0.7136801485\ldots$ on these
collapses, that for $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha = 2$ four vortices go below the three-vortex bounds, and
that eleven vortices in the $\alpha = 2$ model and sixty in the SQG model collapse without rotating.
Numerically, sixty-one Euler vortices reach $P = 0.498\ldots$.
